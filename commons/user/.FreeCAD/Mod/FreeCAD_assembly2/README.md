FreeCAD_assembly2
=================

Assembly workbench for FreeCAD v0.15, 0.16 and 0.17 with support for importing parts from external files.
Although the original programmer of the workbench (hamish) is no longer active
this workbench is still maintained as good as possible.
Feel free to post issues and pull requests.
Assembly2 requires numpy to be installed (bundled with FreeCAD since 0.15.4671).
Thanks to Maurice (easyw-fc) assembly2 will work with files from FreeCAD 0.17.
