# fish-ssh-agent

Utility functions to start your ssh agent when using fish shell.
You will only need to run `ssh-add` and type your password once,
after the running ssh_agent should do the work for you.

fundle plugin 'tuvistavie/fish-ssh-agent'
```

to your `config.fish`, reload your shell and run `fundle install`.

### Manually
